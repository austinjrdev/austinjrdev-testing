# Introduction 

AustinJrDev is an application to cultivate junior Full Stack Developers based in Austin through mentorship and resources. It allows those who would like to be mentees and mentors to sign up with their github and share their skills while also sharpening them.  

# Technologies Used


* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/)




# Motivation

We decided to create this application thinking of those who have recently started learning coding and are overwhelmed by the amount of resources online, just like we did five months ago. Providing precise explanations for what different stack acronyms mean and how they function together, AustinJrDev offers a clear foundation to the beginners and directs them to a clear path they can choose. Its local platform for Austin coders makes it considerably simpler for the junior coders to connect with the amazing Austin tech community without being overwhelmed.
